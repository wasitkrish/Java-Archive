START
Declare a 3D array marks with 2 matrices(class) of 2 rows(student) and 2 columns(subject)
FOR class i from 0 to number of class-1 DO
FOR student j from 0 to number of students-1 DO
SET total=0
FOR subject k from 0 to number of subjects-1 DO
total=total+marks[i][j][k]
END FOR
PRINT"Class i student j total=total"
END FOR 
END FOR
END


Explaination:
- each matrix represents a class
- each row represent a student
- each column represents a subject
- outer loop moves class wise
- middle loop moves student wise
- inner loop accumulates marks of the student
