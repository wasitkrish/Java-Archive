START
Declare a 2D array with 3 rows(products) and 4 columns(days)
FOR each product i from 0 to product-1 Do
SET sum=0
FOR each day j from 0 to day-1 Do
sum=sum+sales[i][j]
END FOR
PRINT"Product i total sales=sum"
END FOR
END


Explaination:
- each row represents one product
- each column represents sales for a day
- outer loop -> moves product wise
- inner loop -> accumulates daily sales for that product
