START
Declare a 3D array temperatures with 2 matrices(rooms) of 2 rows(days) and 2 columns(temperatures)

START
FOR each room i from 0 to number of rooms-1 DO
SET sum=0
SET count=0
FOR each day j from 0 to number of days-1 DO
FOR each temp k from 0 to number of temp-1 DO
sum=sum+temperature[i][j][k]
count=count+1
END FOR
END FOR
PRINT"Room i average = sum/count"
END FOR
END


Explaination:
- each matrix represents a room
- each row represents a day
- each column represents a temperature reading
- outer loop moves room wise
- sum and count are initially set to 0
- middle loop moves day wise
- inner loop accumulates temperature readings and increases the count by 1
- average room temperature is given by sum/count
