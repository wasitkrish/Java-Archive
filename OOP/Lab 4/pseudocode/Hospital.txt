Explaination:
- each matrix represents a ward
- each row represents a day
- each column represents a time slot
- The first outer loop moves ward wise
- The first middle loop moves day wise
- The first inner loop accumulates sum of patients across time slots, increments count by 1 and checks if the number of patients is greater than max or not.
- if number of patients is greater than max then max is set to the number of patients at that index
- average is calculated by sum divide by count
- if average is greater than or equal to 45 then ward is printed as overloaded, else not.
-The second loop starts from days->ward->time slots to check average patients across all wards and time slots in a day.
- sum and count are re-initialized
- The inner loop accumulates sum and increments count
- average is calculated and if day average is greater than 40 hospital is marked a sunder stress
