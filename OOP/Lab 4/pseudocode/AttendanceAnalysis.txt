START
Declare a 2D array attendance with 3 rows(Students) and 5 columns(days)
(1=present, 0=absent)

FOR each student i from 0 to number of students-1 DO
SET sum=0
FOR each day j from 0 to number of days-1 DO
sum=sum+attendance[i][j]
END FOR
PRINT"Student i attendance=sum"
END FOR
END


Explaination:
- each row represents a student
- each column represents days that student was present or absent
- present is represented by 1 and absent by 0 on each day
- adding ones directly gives total presence count
- structure is row wise traversal same as matrix logic
