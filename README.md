## 📘 Java Archive – Academic Practice Repository

This repository contains my **2nd semester Java practice work**, developed as part of two
**separate undergraduate courses**:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**

The repository serves as an **academic archive** of practice programs, lab work,
and concept implementations completed throughout the semester.

---

## 🎓 Academic Context

- **Language**: Java  
- **Semester**: Second Semester  
- **Level**: Undergraduate  
- **Purpose**: Academic learning, hands-on practice, and concept reinforcement  

The primary goal of this repository is to strengthen **core Java programming skills**
while building a solid foundation in **object-oriented design principles** and
**algorithmic problem solving**.

---

## 🧠 Courses Covered

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (Java)

This section focuses on applying object-oriented principles using Java,
with emphasis on clean design and conceptual clarity.

Key concepts include:
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Constructors and Method Overloading
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- Packages and Access Modifiers

---

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)

This section focuses on implementing and understanding fundamental
data structures and algorithms using Java.

Key topics include:
- Arrays and Strings
- Recursion
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Stack and Queue implementations
- Linked Lists
- Basic algorithmic problem solving
- Time and space complexity (introductory level)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this repository and coursework, I aim to:

- Develop a strong understanding of **Java syntax and semantics**
- Apply **OOP principles** to real programming problems
- Implement fundamental **data structures** from scratch
- Improve **logical thinking and problem-solving skills**
- Write readable, modular, and maintainable Java code

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- **Java (JDK 17+)**
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code (or equivalent)
- **Platform**: Linux / Windows
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is intended for **academic practice only**.
- Code is written with a focus on **learning and clarity**, not production optimization.
- The repository will be **continuously updated** as the semester progresses.
- Structure and content may evolve as new topics are introduced.
